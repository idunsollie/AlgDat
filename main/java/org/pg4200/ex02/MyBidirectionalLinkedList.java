/*
Using `MyLinkedList` as a starting point, create a new class called `MyBidirectionalLinkedList`.
Here, besides a `next` link, each node also has a `previous` link pointing to the previous node in
the list. All insert/delete operations need to properly handle and update such `previous` links.
When inserting/deleting/getting a node at position `index`, the algorithm should decide if rather start
the search from `head` using `next` links, or from `tail` using the `previous` links.
If `index <= size()/2`, it makes sense to start from `head`.
On the other hand, when `index > size()/2` it would be more efficient to start from `tail`.

Write a `MyBidirectionalLinkedListTest` that extends `MyListTestTemplate`.
If your implementation is correct, all tests should pass.
Run the tests with code coverage enabled, and verify that all of the instructions in your
code are covered. If not, add new tests to `MyBidirectionalLinkedListTest`.
